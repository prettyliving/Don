  <h2>A Poem for Don</h2>

  <p class="poem-text">
I met you before I knew<br>
what staying meant. <br>
Before memory had a spine. <br>
Before I could name the way <br>
a life can be held together <br>
by someone who simply doesn’t leave. <br>
<br>
You didn’t arrive with a title. <br>
No script. <br>
No obligation written in blood. <br>
Just hands that showed up. <br>
Again.<br> 
And again. <br>
And again<br> 
like it was the easiest decision in the world.<br> 

You made ordinary days feel chosen. <br>
Visits weren’t obligations <br>
they were events.<br> 
Time slowed down when you were there<br> 
as if the world knew<br> 
this was something worth pausing for.<br> 
<br>
You never announced yourself as anything. <br>
You just were. <br>
Steady. <br>
Present.<br> 
A constant in a life that could’ve tilted<br> 
but didn’t<br> 
because you stood where balance was needed. <br>
<br> 
I’m twenty now.<br> 
Old enough to understand<br> 
that love isn’t noise.<br> 
It’s consistency. <br>
It’s the quiet courage<br> 
of always showing up <br>
even when no one is keeping score. <br>
<br> 
So thank you <br>
for choosing me<br> 
without ever having to say you did.<br> 
For being proof that family<br> 
is built<br> 
one kept promise at a time. <br>
<br>
And if I don’t say it enough <br>
know this <br>
I saw you.<br> 
I still do.<br>

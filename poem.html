  <h2>A Poem for Don</h2>

  <p class="poem-text">
I met you before I knew
what staying meant.
Before memory had a spine.
Before I could name the way
a life can be held together
by someone who simply doesn’t leave.

You didn’t arrive with a title.
No script.
No obligation written in blood.
Just hands that showed up.
Again.
And again.
And again
like it was the easiest decision in the world.

You made ordinary days feel chosen.
Visits weren’t obligations;
they were events.
Time slowed down when you were there
as if the world knew
this was something worth pausing for.

You never announced yourself as anything.
You just were.
Steady.
Present.
A constant in a life that could’ve tilted
but didn’t
because you stood where balance was needed.

I’m twenty now.
Old enough to understand
that love isn’t noise.
It’s consistency.
It’s the quiet courage
of always showing up
even when no one is keeping score.

So thank you
for choosing me
without ever having to say you did.
For being proof that family
is built
one kept promise at a time.

And if I don’t say it enough
know this
I saw you.
I still do.
